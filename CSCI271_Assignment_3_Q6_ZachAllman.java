* Assignment 3, Question 6 for CSCI 271-001 Spring 2026
*
* Author: Zach Allman
* OS: Ubuntu 24.04.3 LTS
* Compiler: javac 21.0.9
* Date: February 25 2026
*
* Purpose
* This program reads a list of integers from the keyboard and stores
* them into an array A, then returns the sum of all even integers in A
* using a recursive function sumEven(). The function is recursive and
* does not print anything to the screen; only the main program prints
* the resulting sum. No loops are used in the sumEven function.
*
